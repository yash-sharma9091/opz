            You will have the most success and speed up connecting with another Zenbrisa member if you can show the other member a clear, square closeup photo of yourself. Everyone wants to place a face with a name. In order to Upload a Profile Photo, please first upload a photo to your Public or Private Photos and then click on the green icon on the bottom left corner of the photo. Once the Profile Photo appears in the left corner of your profile, it may appear a bit distorted. You will see a Cropping Tool in order to optimize your photo and remove the distortion.
