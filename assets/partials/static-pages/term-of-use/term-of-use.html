            The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Website shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our

         <p><b>Arbitration Procedures</b></p>
         <p>1. Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the Arbitration Procedures) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and Zenbrisa.com.</p>
         <p>2. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Zenbrisa.com is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence an arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may online or at Zentiera, LLC, 2711 Centerville Rd., Suite 400, Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19808, U.S.A., Attention: Legal Department.</p>
         <p>3. Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is the American Arbitration Association (AAA), a non-profit organization that is not affiliated with Zenbrisa.com. The AAA facilitates, but does not itself conduct, the arbitration. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be chosen from the AAAs roster of neutral arbitrators. For information on the AAA and the AAAs rules and fees for consumer disputes, please visit its website at http://www.adr.org.</p>
         <p>4. Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the AAAs Consumer Arbitration Rules (the AAA Rules), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. To obtain copies of the AAAs Rules and the related AAAs Fee Schedule, please visit the AAA website at https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the AAA Rules.</p>
         <p>5. Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against Zenbrisa.com, you must complete a short form,
            submit it to the AAA, and send a copy to Zenbrisa.com at Zentiera, LLC, 2711 Centerville Rd., Suite 400, Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19808, U.S.A., Attention: Legal Department. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute arbitration, see the AAAs claim filing page and its guide on Representing Yourself in Arbitration at the AAA website. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, Zenbrisa.com may assert any counterclaims it may have against the complaining party.
         </p>
         <p>6. Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the AAAs fee schedule for consumer disputes. Zenbrisa.com will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against Zenbrisa.com is for less than $1,000, we will pay all fees. If you believe you cannot afford the AAAs fee, you may apply to the AAA for a fee waiver.</p>
         <p>7. Selection of the Arbitrator. The parties, using the AAAs standard procedures, will select a single arbitrator from a roster of neutrals prepared by the AAA.</p>
         <p>8. Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrators appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.</p>
         <p>9. Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other  for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.</p>
         <p>10. Confidentiality. Upon either partys request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>
         <p>11. Arbitration Award. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.</p>
