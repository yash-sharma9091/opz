                  It is your choice! Zenbrisa offers our members the ability to arrange a massage trade with another member in our network. If you need a massage right now and you don't have time to connect with other members to arrange an exchange or you just want to receive a massage without exchanging, a reasonably priced paid massage is a great option. All paid massages advertised on Zenbrisa are $/€ /€ 49.99 or less. We highly encourage all fee-based Professional Masseurs promoting their business or advertising their business on our website to offer very competitive rates so that they can obtain great new clients and get excellent repeat business. There are many masseurs advertising online with high prices and no business. We want to help set everyone up for success.

                  Once you register as a member on our website, you will receive confirmation that your registration was accepted. At that point, we encourage all members to upload photos in our Photo Gallery located under the Profile tab. You will be able to upload Photos/Videos (Videos hosted on YouTube). You will have much better luck lining up massage partners once someone can place the name with a photo. You can upload Profile Photo, Public Photos, Private Photos and/or Videos within the Photo Gallery. You can also upload Profile Photo in Edit Profile. All our members will be able to view your Public Photos but you must give a PhotoKey to those members that you want to see your Private Photos and all Videos. A member will either ask you to send a PhotoKey or you can take the initiative by just sending a PhotoKey to any member you choose. Please DO NOT attempt to post any lewd or pornographic photos or videos on our site. Tasteful nude photos are OK but we reserve the right to censor or refuse to post any photos or videos that cross the line such as sex acts, etc.

               <ul>
                  <li> <b>Set yourself up for success</b> - a bit of planning makes all the difference.
                  </li>
                  <li>Good judge of character - We do not endorse any members. It is up to you, like on any social networking site to do your due diligence in advance to feel comfortable with the person that you will be trading with or receiving a massage from.
                  </li>
                  <li>Be respectfully timely! Give each other your mobile numbers to text or call in case of delays or necessary cancellations. Do not be a â€œno-showâ€. No one likes a â€œflakeâ€.
                  </li>
                  <li>Normal length of massage is 45 min to 1 hour. If you are exchanging massages with another person, make sure to allot enough time so that both parties get a similar amount of massage time.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Communication is key </b>- communicate with your massage partner or masseur in advance of preferred massage styles, injuries, sensitivities, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>Make sure that both parties are cleanly showered. It is really disrespectful to ask another person to work on a dirty body.
                  </li>
                  <li>	If you are hosting, be respectful and make sure that your massage space is clean and if you are providing a place for your exchange partner to shower, make sure that the bathroom is clean as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>	Make sure to communicate in advance about supplies needed (sheets, towels, oil, etc) and who will provide.
                  </li>
                  <li>	Both parties agree on a quiet warm location - nothing worse than being cold during a massage.
                  </li>
                  <li>	Phones turned off.
                  </li>
                  <li>	Soothing music and dimmed lighting.
                  </li>
                  <li>	Be respectful with boundaries of your massage partner - again communication is key.
